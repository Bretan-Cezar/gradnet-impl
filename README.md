# gradnet-impl
Unofficial implementation of the "GradNet Image Denoising" paper. 

Includes:
 - Code for model implementation, training and inference, custom datasets; fully configured via YAML specification files;
 - Interfunctionality with DnCNN and BM3D as the "naive denoisers";
 - Presentation on the general problem, the literature, the paper's proposed method, own setup, tests and experiments using implementation and results;
